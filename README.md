# BSEC Library Integration on STM32 
 
This program integrates the BSEC Library from Bosch Sensortech to an STM32L010RBT6 board connected to a BME688 sensor module. The sensor module comes from Waveshare Electronics. The readings of the sensor are printed to the USART2 port at the 115200 baud rate/8 data bits/no parity bit/1 stop bit configuration.
